# can we unset the nameref attribute on variables with values that reference
# unset variables?

unset bar
declare -n foo="bar"
declare -p foo

declare +n foo
declare -p foo bar

declare -n foo
declare -p foo

# let's try removing the nameref attribute -- other attributes and assignments
# apply to the nameref target

declare +n -i foo=7+4
declare -p foo bar

unset foo bar

# but if the nameref variable doesn't have a value, the attributes apply to
# the nameref variable itself. thanks ksh93

declare -n foo6
declare -xi foo6
declare -p foo6

# and when we remove the nameref attribute, the other attributes remain

declare +n foo6
declare -p foo6

unset foo6

# make sure these cases continue to work

# nameref referencing an existing, set variable
declare -n foo=bar
bar='Hello World!'
declare -p foo bar
declare +n foo
declare -p foo bar
unset foo bar

# nameref referencing an existing, unset variable
declare -n foo=bar
declare bar
declare -p foo bar
declare +n foo
declare -p foo bar

# but when we add the nameref attribute, we remove other attributes

declare -i ivar
ivar=4+4
echo $ivar

declare -n ivar=foo
declare -p ivar
