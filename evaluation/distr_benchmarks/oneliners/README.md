## Expert One-liners

This directory contains ten scripts collected by several sources, including GitHub, Stackoverflow, and the Unix literature.
They are written by developers who are (or approximate) experts in Unix shell scripting, and include several Unix classics.

1. `nfa-regex.sh`          Match complex regular-expression over input
2. `sort.sh`               Sort a text input
3. `top-n.sh`              Find the top 1000 terms in a document
4. `wf.sh`                 Calculate the frequency of each word in the document, and sort by frequency
5. `spell.sh`              Compute mispelled words in an input document
6. `bi-grams.sh`           Find all 2-grams in a piece of text
7. `diff.sh`               Compares two streams element by element
8. `set-diff.sh`           Show the set-difference between two streams (i.e., elements in the first that are not in the second).
9. `shortest-scripts.sh`   Find the shortest scripts 
10.`sort-sort.sh`          Calculate sort twice

The `bi-grams.aux.sh` script contains helper functions for `bi-grams.sh`. 
To generate inputs, run `./generate_inputs`.
