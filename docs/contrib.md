## PaSh on Docker: A Pocket Guide

This is a pocket guide for running PaSh in a docker container.

### Loading image

The latest docker container runs PaSh in a pre-configured Ubuntu 18.04 image, loadable as 

```sh
curl img.pash.ndr.md | docker load
```

Then, to create a writable container from this image, run:

```sh
docker run --name pash-playground -it pash/18.04  
```

This will use `pash-playground` for the container (to be able to start/stop it later) and `-it` runs it interactively (subsuming the next command).

After exiting (or if not `-it` is used), one can start the container with:
```sh
docker start -i pash-playground
```

Flag `-i` starts it interactively.

### Customizing image

To be used for continuous integration and testing, this image has been configured to have _read-only_ access to the repo through a different user.
To get write access, update the name and email used for `git` commits with your name and email, and [generate an ssh key pair](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

```sh
git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"
git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL@example.com"
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "YOUR_EMAIL@example.com"
```

Finally, [add the key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

### Basic Docker commands

This is a small list of useful docker commands. Docker distinguishes between an image (a pre-setup environment) and a container (a running or stopped instance of an image, created with `run`). `NN` below refers to the name of the container, provided to `run`. Containers are always identified uniquely by a sha256 string, which can be useful if no name is given.

```
docker images                    # shows all images in the system
docker ps -a | grep pash         # shows all containers with name pash
docker run --name NN pash/18.04  # creates a writable container (add `-it` for interactive)
docker start -i NN               # starts container (add `-i` to drop straight into shell)
docker attach NN                 # non-interactive -> interactive
<CTL+p>, then <CTL+q>            # interactive -> non-interactive
docker cp A B                    # copy host<->container; A B can be `NN:/x/y/z` or `lo/c/al`
```

Useful options for `docker run`:
* [Mount host storage](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/): `-v /HST:/IN/NN`
* [Limit CPU/Mem](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/): `--cpus='.5' --mem=1g`
* [Limit disk size](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#set-storage-driver-options-per-container): `--storage-opt size=10G`

## Using GNU Screen

We often use GNU `screen`, a terminal multiplexer, for pair programming. GNU `screen` has two benefits: (1) it allows a session to continue executing even after one detaches and closes the terminal window, which is useful for executing long-running processes such as PaSh's experiments; and (2) it allows multiple people to share a session, with the ability to read and write in the terminal window as if it was a single person.

Here are commands related to launching a screen session:
* `screen`                   -> start a new session
* `screen -ls`               -> show all screen sessions in this machine
* `screen -x <ID>`           -> attach to screen with id `<ID>`, as shown by `-ls` above.
* `screen -x <user>/<pash>`  -> attach to session `pash` of user `user`, assuming it exists/running; 

When in a `screen` session, all `screen`-related commands are prefixed by `ctr-a` (which means pressing `ctrl` and `a` _together_, and _then_ pressing the followup character). Here are the 5 most useful commands:
* `ctrl-a c`                 -> createÂ­a new window in the current session
* `ctrl-a "`                 -> show all windows and choose using up/down arrows
* `ctr-a <N>`                -> go to window <N>, where <N> is 0..9 inclusive
* `ctrl-a ctrl-a`            -> fast-toggle between latest windows
* `ctrl-a d`                 -> detach window, to exit without closing screen

## Pushing to new branches

To keep the main branch free of breakage, we often push technical work in new branches. To do this, from the main/master branch on your local machine:

```sh
git checkout -b <NAME>    # create a new branch and switch to it
git push -u origin <NAME> # push the new branch as a new branch on github
```

You can always fetch changes into the main/master:

```sh
git checkout master        # switch to main/master
git pull                   # fetch remote changes
git checkout <NAME>        # switch back to your branch
git merge master           # fetch changes from main/master
```

(You can use `rebase` instead of `merge` if your branch is local and hasn't been pushed to GitHub, but `merge` if your branch is already pushed.)

## Commit Messages

It's important to write [clear commit messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
At a minimum, a short single-line summary at the top with verbs in present tense:-)

## Process for Using EC2 Instance 

A reason to use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is having insufficient computing power in your local machine. The steps to do are as follows. The generated key is of the form user@hostname.

1. Make changes in local Docker
2. `git push` in local Docker
3. Run `scripts/ssh-install.sh ~/.ssh/id_rsa <hostname>` in cloned pash repository on local machine (pulls changes from GitHub)
4. Run `ssh <SSH Key>`. The changes will have automatically been transferred over. Can confirm with `git log`.
