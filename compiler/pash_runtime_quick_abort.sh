## Solution Schematic:
##
##  (A)      (B)      (C)       (D)        (E)
## stdin --- tee --- eager --- seq.sh --- eager --- OUT_SEQ
##            \      (F)
##             \--- eager --- PAR_IN
##
## (1) If compiler fails, or sequential is done executing:
##     - cat OUT_SEQ > stdout
##
## (2) If compiler succeeds:
##     - USR1 to reroute so that it redirects to /dev/null
##     - PAR_IN redirect to par stdin.
##
## Simplifying assumptions:
## - Not worrying about stderr
## - Not worrying about other inputs at the moment (assuming they are files if compiler succeeds)
## - Not worrying about other outputs 
##   + assuming that the parallel implementation will overwrite them
##   + Assuming that the DFG outputs are not appended
##
## TODO: A first TODO would be to check them in the compilation process
##
## TODO: An alternative TODO would be to let preprocessing give us information about them, allowing us to 
##       have a finer tuned execution plan depending on this information. For example, if we see that script
##       has append to some file we can be carefull and buffer its output using eager.

## NOTE: The intuition about why quick-abort works is that if the compilation succeeds, then the
##       script is a DFG, meaning that we know exactly how it affects its environment after completing.
##       Therefore, we can go back and stop the already running script without risking unsafe behavior.

## TODO: We also want to avoid executing the compiled script if it doesn't contain any improvement.

## TODO: Maybe the reroute needs to be put around (C) and not (D)

## TODO: Improve the happy path (very fast sequential) execution time 

## TODO: Use reroute around dgsh_tees to make sure that they do not use storage unnecessarily 
##       (if their later command is done).
