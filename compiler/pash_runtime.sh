## Assumes the following two variables are set:
## pash_sequential_script_file: the sequential script. Just running it should work for all tests.
## pash_input_ir_file: the file that contains the IR to be compiled 

## When called by spec, assumes this variable is set:
## pash_spec_command_id: the node id for the specific command


##
## High level design. 
##
## (1) The `pash_runtime` should behave as a wrapper, saving all the necessary state:
##     - previous exit code
##     - previous set status
##     - previous variables
##     and then reverting to PaSh internal state
##
## (2) Then it should perform pash-internal work.
##
## (3) Then it should make sure to revert the exit code and `set` state to the saved values.
##
## (4) Then it should execute the inside script (either original or parallel)
##
## (5) Then it save all necessary state and revert to pash-internal state. 
##     (At the moment this happens automatically because the script is ran in a subshell.)
##
## (6) Then it should do all left pash internal work.
##
## (7) Before exiting it should revert all exit state.
##
## Visually:
##
## -- bash -- | -- pash --
##    ...     |
##      \----(1)----\
##            |     ...
##            |     (2)
##            |     ...
##      /----(3)----/
##    ...     |
##    (4)     |
##    ...     |
##
## (The rest of the steps happen only in debug mode)
##    ...
##      \----(5)----\
##            |     ...
##            |     (6)
##            |     ...
##      /----(7)----/
##    ...     |

## TODO: Make a shell script that is called wrap and
##       takes three arguments (pre_script, script, post_script)
##       and wraps a shell script file with a pre and a post code.
##
##       This wrap function should perform only the necessary shell setting,
##       exit code, and $!, transfer. Arguments should ideally be transfered too but
##       I don't know of a good way to do it for an external script from an internal one.
##
##       Maybe it can happen with eval
##
## The challenging aspect is how to make this work for the parallel pipelines

## First save the state of the shell
source "$RUNTIME_DIR/save_shell_state.sh"
## Rename variables to pash specific names
