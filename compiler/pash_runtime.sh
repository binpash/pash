##
## High level design. 
##
## (1) The `pash_runtime` should behave as a wrapper, saving all the necessary state:
##     - previous exit code
##     - previous set status
##     - previous variables
##     and then reverting to PaSh internal state
##
## (2) Then it should perform pash-internal work.
##
## (3) Then it should make sure to revert the exit code and `set` state to the saved values.
##
## (4) Then it should execute the inside script (either original or parallel)
##     TODO: Figure out what could be different before (1), during (4), and after (7) 
##
## (5) Then it save all necessary state and revert to pash-internal state. 
##     (At the moment this happens automatically because the script is ran in a subshell.)
##
## (6) Then it should do all left pash internal work.
##
## (7) Before exiting it should revert all exit state.
##
## Visually:
##
## -- bash -- | -- pash --
##    ...     |
##      \----(1)----\
##            |     ...
##            |     (2)
##            |     ...
##      /----(3)----/
##    ...     |
##    (4)     |
##    ...     |
##
## (The rest of the steps happen only in debug mode)
##    ...
##      \----(5)----\
##            |     ...
##            |     (6)

## Necessary for pash:
## - PATH important for PaSh but might be changed in bash
## - IFS has to be kept default for PaSh to work
##
## Necessary for bash:
## - Last PID $! (TODO)
## - Last exit code $?
## - set state $-
## - File descriptors (TODO)
## - Loop state (?) Maybe `source` is adequate for this (TODO)
## - Traos (TODO)
##
## (maybe) TODO: After that, maybe we can create cleaner functions for (1), (3), (5), (7). 
##               E.g. we can have a correspondence between variable names and revert them using them
