## TODOs before merging to `future`

- support for RR with unwrap for commutative commands
- working on all tests
- clean up utils for annotations
- graphviz
- Changing PaSh flags (making the default be priority r-split and then consecutive chunks), so remove the r_split flag and make defaults be the ones from the OSDI paper
- Fixing annotation library installation to a specific commit
- Remove code which got obsolete due to the changes
