## TODOs before merging to `future`

- separate checking and application of parallelization
- cat-split fusion
- r-unwrap-commutative fusion
- working on all tests
- Adding annotation library installation and removing ad-hoc import of the latter
- clean up utils for annotations
- graphviz
- Changing PaSh flags (making the default be priority r-split and then consecutive chunks), so remove the r_split flag and make defaults be the ones from the OSDI paper
