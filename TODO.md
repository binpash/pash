## TODOs before merging to `future`

- aggregation trees
- r_split
- cat-split fusion
- working on all tests
- Adding annotation library installation and removing ad-hoc import of the latter
- clean up utils for annotations
- Changing PaSh flags (making the default be priority r-split and then consecutive chunks), so remove the r_split flag and make defaults be the ones from the OSDI paper (I can do that TODO too)
