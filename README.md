## Running PaSh

To parallelize, say, `./evaluation/intro/hello-world.sh` with parallelization degree of 2× run:

```sh
./pa.sh ./evaluation/intro/hello-world.sh
```

Run `./pa.sh --help` to get more information about the available commands.

## Installation

On Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, or Arch, run `curl up.pash.ndr.md | sh` to set up PaSh.

For more details, manual installation, or other platforms see [installation instructions](./docs/install).

## Testing

To execute the current tests before committing and pushing code, simply run:

```sh
./scripts/run_tests.sh
```

## Repo Structure

This repo hosts the core `pash` development. The structure is as follows:

* [annotations](./annotations/): DSL characterizing commands, parallelizability study, and associated annotations.
* [compiler](./compiler): Shell-dataflow translations and associated parallelization transformations.
* [docs](./docs): Design documents, tutorials, installation instructions, etc.
* [evaluation](./evaluation): Shell pipelines and example [scripts](./evaluation/other/more-scripts) used for the evaluation.
* [runtime](./runtime): Runtime component — e.g., `eager`, `split`, and assocaited combiners.
* [scripts](./scripts): Scripts related to continuous integration, deployment, and testing.
