## News

* We are organizing a [HotOS'21](https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2021/) panel/round-table on the future of the shell: [Thu 3 Jun, 1–2:30pm EDT](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MTFrN2tpbWJuMTVmZHBuazduOGpkNThqamIgNWo1MTBsNGIzY2VoYTc2bmVzc3FtMDhnNGtAZw&tmsrc=5j510l4b3ceha76nessqm08g4k%40group.calendar.google.com) | [More info](https://fut-shell.github.io/) | [Register](https://web.cvent.com/2event/ea21de2e-ff68-470b-8b09-743b6572c469/)

## Running PaSh

To parallelize, say, `./evaluation/intro/hello-world.sh` with parallelization width of `2`, from the top-level directory of the repository run:

```sh
./pa.sh ./evaluation/intro/hello-world.sh
``` 

Run `./pa.sh --help` to get more information about the available commands.
See [docs/tutorial](docs/tutorial.md) for a longer tutorial.

## Installation

On Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, or Arch, run `curl up.pash.ndr.md | sh` to setup PaSh.
Alternatively, you can clone the repo and run `./scripts/distro-deps.sh;
./scripts/setup-pash.sh`

You can also built the Docker container from scratch by running
```sh
git clone git@github.com:andromeda/pash.git
cd pash/scripts
docker build -t "pash/18.04" .
# Then launch container:
docker run --name pash-play -it pash/18.04
```

More installation instructions in [the tutorial](./docs/tutorial.md#installation).
Remember to `export` `PASH_TOP` in your startup scripts!

## Testing

To execute the current tests before committing and pushing code, simply run:

```sh
./scripts/run_tests.sh
```

## Repo Structure

This repo hosts the core `pash` development. The structure is as follows:

* [annotations](./annotations/): DSL characterizing commands, parallelizability study, and associated annotations.
* [compiler](./compiler): Shell-Dataflow translations and associated parallelization transformations.
* [docs](./docs): Design documents, tutorials, installation instructions, etc.
* [evaluation](./evaluation): Shell pipelines and example [scripts](./evaluation/scripts) used for the evaluation.
* [runtime](./runtime): Runtime component — e.g., `eager`, `split`, and assocaited combiners.
* [scripts](./scripts): Scripts related to continuous integration, deployment, and testing.
