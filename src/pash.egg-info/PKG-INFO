## Running PaSh

To parallelize, say, `./evaluation/intro/hello-world.sh` with parallelization degree of 2× run:

```sh
./pa.sh ./evaluation/intro/hello-world.sh
```

If the script contains bash specific syntax, add the beta `--bash` flag to enable support.

Run `./pa.sh --help` to get more information about the available commands.
Jump to [docs/tutorial](docs/tutorial/) for a longer tutorial.

## Installation

### Via pip (Recommended)
```sh
pip install pash
pash -c "echo hi"
```

### From source
On Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian run the following to set up PaSh.
```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binpash/pash/main/scripts/up.sh
sh up.sh
export PASH_TOP="$PWD/pash/"
## Run PaSh with echo hi
"$PASH_TOP/pa.sh" -c "echo hi"
```

For more details, manual installation, or other platforms see [installation instructions](./docs/install).

## Running with a local annotations library

To run with a local version of the library, please refer to the documentation [local annotations setup and usage](docs/local-annotations-library-documentation.md) 

## Repo Structure

This repo hosts the core `pash` development. The structure is as follows:

* [src/pash/](./src/pash/): Main Python package (installed via pip)
  * [preprocessor](./src/pash/preprocessor): Parses shell scripts, expands variables, and identifies dataflow regions for compilation.
  * [compiler](./src/pash/compiler): Translates shell dataflow regions to IRs and applies parallelization transformations.
  * [jit_runtime](./src/pash/jit_runtime): Just-in-time runtime that executes compiled regions and manages shell state.
  * [runtime](./src/pash/runtime): Runtime components — e.g., `eager`, `split`, and associated combiners.
* [docs](./docs): Design documents, tutorials, installation instructions, etc.
* [evaluation](./evaluation): Shell pipelines and example [scripts](./evaluation/other/more-scripts) used for the evaluation.
* [scripts](./scripts): Scripts related to continuous integration, deployment, and testing.
