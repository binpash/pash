# Aggregators

Currently aggregators are WIP. The new ones are in `cpp/bin`. They are automatically built during `setup_pash.sh` and the unit tests in `cpp/tests` are run during `run_tests.sh`. The interface is like the following:

```sh
aggregator inputFile1 inputFile2 args
```

Where `args` are the arguments that were passed to the command that produced the input files. The aggregator outputs to `stdout`.

## Adding new aggregators

Let's assume that the aggregator being implemented is for a command called `cmd`.

1. Create a folder named `cmd` inside `cpp/aggregators`

2. For each `OS` supported by PaSh:

    2.1 Create a file named `OS-agg.h` inside that folder

    2.2. Implement the aggregator inside that file using the instructions provided in `cpp/common/main.h` or use a different aggregator as an example. Remember about the include guard.

    2.3 You may create additional files in the aggregator directory. This can be used to share code between aggregator implementations for different `OS`es. When `#include`ing, assume that the aggregator directory is in the include path.

3. Add unit tests for the created aggregator in `cpp/tests/test-OS.sh` for each `OS`. Consult the instructions in that file. Remember to test all options and flags of the aggregator.

Note: after completing these steps the aggregator will automatically be built by the `Makefile` with no changes to it required.
